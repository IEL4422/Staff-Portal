Generate Documents correctly navigates to a page instead of opening a modal. Modal close functionality (X button and Cancel button) works properly. Dashboard remains visible behind modals and user stays on current page after closing modals.",

All sidebar action buttons (Add Client, Add Lead, Add Task, Add Date/Deadline, Add Case Contact, Add Asset/Debt, Phone Call Intake, Send Case Update, Send Invoice, Send Mail, Upload File) open as pop-up modals over the current page. Generate Documents correctly navigates to /actions/generate-documents page. Modal system uses React Context (ActionModalsContext) for state management. Forms inside modals have Cancel and Submit buttons. Previous iteration (iteration_1.json) noted Airtable field name mismatches causing form submission failures - those backend issues are separate from this modal UI feature."
